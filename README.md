# PaapiMini

* This is a Gem for easy Amazon product search.<br>
Before using it, you need to pass Amazon Associate review and get ACCESS_KEY etc. as preparation.
* [Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/)ã€€is supported.
* This Gem is implemented using only the Ruby standard-attached library, so it does not depend on other Gems.

* Ruby versions that have been tested by rbenv
```
ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [x86_64-darwin20]
ruby 3.0.0rc1 (2020-12-20 master 8680ae9cbd) [x86_64-darwin20]
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x86_64-darwin21]
```
* We have not tested Ruby for Windows at this time.<br>
Also, since the author's Amazon Associate review is conducted by Amazon.co.jp, we are only able to test from this region.<br>
Therefore, the default behavior of the API is Amazon.co.jp. It is possible to change it with an argument.<br>
We would appreciate it if you could provide us with feedback if you can confirm that it works on the Windows version or in regions other than Amazon.co.jp.
