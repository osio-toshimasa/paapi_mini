# PaapiMini

* For Japanese [README_ja.md](./README_ja.md)
* This is a Gem for easy Amazon product search.<br>
Before using it, you need to pass Amazon Associate review and get ACCESS_KEY etc. as preparation.
* [Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/)ã€€is supported.
* This Gem is implemented using only the Ruby standard-attached library, so it does not depend on other Gems.

* Ruby versions that have been tested by rbenv
```
ruby 2.7.2p137 (2020-10-01 revision 5445e04352) [x86_64-darwin20]
ruby 3.0.0rc1 (2020-12-20 master 8680ae9cbd) [x86_64-darwin20]
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x86_64-darwin21]
```
* We have not tested Ruby for Windows at this time.<br>
Also, since the author's Amazon Associate review is conducted by Amazon.co.jp, we are only able to test from this region.<br>
Therefore, the default behavior of the API is Amazon.co.jp. It is possible to change it with an argument.<br>
We would appreciate it if you could provide us with feedback if you can confirm that it works on the Windows version or in regions other than Amazon.co.jp.

## If you like this Gem, I'd be happy to help.

* Development is currently suspended. This is because the API response results in an error if no Amazon Associate sales results are generated for 30 days.
* If you like this Gem, we would appreciate it if you could buy Amazon products from [this link](https://amzn.to/3Ta7pvV).
* It doesn't matter what the price is, it doesn't matter if it is another product that you followed from this link.
* Once we have achieved sales and the API restrictions are released, we would like to implement other API support such as get_items, etc.
